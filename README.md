# Generate-Your-Password

## Purpose

To generate a randomized password with criteria specified by the user to fit their needs. 

When the user clicks the button to generate a password, they are presented wit ha series of prompts for password criteria. When they are prompted with the length of the password, they input a number that is between 8 and 128 and are then asked to confirm if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. It is then validated that the user has selected at least one character type. Once all prompts are completed and validated, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and displays on the original page. This was all achieved in JavaScript, using functions, conditional statements, event listeners, arrays, prompts, alerts, loops, and many other elements.
